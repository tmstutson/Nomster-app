Users are directed to an intial signup screen where they are directed to create a username or password to access the application features. 

Next the user can upload places, add a photo and write a brief description of the place. 
Users can then rate their place with a scale of up to five stars. 

New users of the application can also repeat these features, review other users places and comment a brief description.
